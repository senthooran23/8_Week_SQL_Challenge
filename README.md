Important Note Regarding My Solutions
Hello visitors,

I wanted to address a concerning issue. It has come to my attention that some of the SQL case study solutions on this repository have been copied without permission. I want to emphasize that this behaviour goes against the principles of academic integrity and intellectual honesty.

Creating these solutions has been a labour of love, involving substantial time and effort. Therefore, I kindly ask that you avoid copying them word for word. Instead, I encourage you to utilize them as a reference and derive inspiration from the underlying concepts, applying them in your own unique way.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm here to support your learning journey and provide guidance.

Thank you for your understanding and for being a part of this community.

Best wishes,

Senthooran E
